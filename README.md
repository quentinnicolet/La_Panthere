# La Panthere
The fourth project of the "Web Developer" course aims to improve the SEO of La Panth√®re agency's website while considering its accessibility. The objectives are as follows:

- Enhance the site's technical performance to optimize its SEO
- Increase traffic through natural referencing (SEO)
- Design accessible web content

The project deliverables in ZIP format include the following:

- A SEO analysis report of the site utilizing the provided template, which clearly identifies the 10 selected recommendations
- The complete source code of the improved site
- An optimization report containing a comparison of the results, including loading speed and accessibility

The mission is to analyze the current state of the website's SEO. This involves identifying the site's parts that are not optimized for SEO and/or accessibility, justifying the choices, and providing the appropriate practice for each section that requires optimization while citing sources. After completing the template, 10 recommendations must be selected to improve the site. These recommendations should be indicated in the "Recommended Action" column.

The ultimate goal is for the website to rank higher when searching for "web design company in Lyon" on search engines. At least one recommendation should focus on site speed and size, and one should focus on accessibility to improve the site for users who currently encounter accessibility issues. The necessary elements to implement the recommendations can be found at the provided link.

The next step involves optimizing the site's content and source code by applying the selected 10 recommendations. The complete source code of the enhanced version of the site must be provided. The site must pass W3C for HTML and CSS.

Lastly, a comparison of the site's loading speed must be conducted as it impacts the ranking in search results. Measures must be taken to accelerate the loading speed, and the effectiveness of these measures must be demonstrated using comparative screenshots between the current and optimized versions of the site. These comparisons must be included in the optimization report.

The website must remain responsive, and the provided SEO checklist with 25 on-site best practices must be utilized as a resource.
